## Basic Idea
Digital tracking of children of the migrant population to follow-up on their health status and immunization services received/to be given.

## Introduction 
One of the challenges facing migrants and refugees is access to medical records. 
The aim of this study was to identify Health Records (HRs) developed specifically for migrants and refugees, describe their characteristics, and discuss their reported strengths and weaknesses.

## Materials and methods
A systematic review of articles focusing on HRs implemented exclusively for migrants and refugees was undertaken. 
Publications were identified by searching the scientific databases Embase, Medline, Scopus and Cochrane, the grey literature and by checking the reference lists of articles.

## The data structures
In this section, we present the data structures necessary for this assignment.

**1. Implementing a top k priority queue:**
To recommend top k users, we use a priority queue that keeps only the top k elements and
serves them in decreasing order of priority. For this, write the `class PQKImp` that implements the
`interface PQK` .

**2. Implementing a map:**
In this step, you write a BST implementation of a map.

## Conclusions
Health records, implemented specifically for migrants and refugees, seem to have the potential to address some of the challenges that they face in accessing health care, in particular in strategic hotspots, cross-border settings and for migrants on the move.
